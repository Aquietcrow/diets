# The rodent diet

This project is basically for building up a workflow of small rodent diet analysis,
focusing on:

```markdown

1. A protocal of collecting samples
2. A protocal of store samples
3. A protocal of dealing with samples in Labs
4. Validate the data/cross validate
```
Then I will focus on building up a diet database with information related to animals, seasons, locations, plant communities, etc.
