# The rodent diet

This project is basically for building up a workflow of small rodent diet analysis,
focusing on:

A: a protocal of collecting samples
B: a protocal of store samples
C: a protocal of dealing with samples in Labs
D: validate the data/cross validate

Then I will focus on building up a diet database with information related to animals, seasons, locations, plant communities, etc.
